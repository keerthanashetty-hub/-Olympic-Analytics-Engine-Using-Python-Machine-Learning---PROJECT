# Olympic Analytics Engine Using Python & Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
The **Olympic Analytics Engine** is a comprehensive data science and machine learning project designed to analyze Olympic history, athlete performance, and country statistics. This project provides deep insights into the Olympics, including medal trends, top-performing athletes, and country-level performance clustering. Additionally, it incorporates predictive models to forecast medal counts and allows rich visualization of Olympic data.

##  Technologies & Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Data Analysis & Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Regression, Clustering)  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive code execution and visualization  
- **Datasets:** Historical Olympic data (athletes, medals, events, countries)

##  Key Features

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
   - Structured datasets for athlete-level and country-level analysis  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualizations**  
   - Bar charts, line plots, count plots, heatmaps, distribution plots  
   - Comparative graphs for medal trends, athlete ages, and country performance  

3. **Athlete Analysis**  
   - Identification of **top athletes** by total medals  
   - Age distribution, medal distribution, and sport-specific insights  

4. **Country Performance Analysis**  
   - Clustering countries based on medal performance using ML  
   - Comparative visualizations of medal counts across nations  

5. **Medal Prediction (Regression Model)**  
   - Predicts total medals a country is likely to win based on historical performance  
   - Uses features such as past medals, athlete participation, and sport-specific trends  

6. **End-to-End ML Capstone Project**  
   - Fully integrated pipeline: data cleaning → EDA → visualization → ML modeling → prediction
